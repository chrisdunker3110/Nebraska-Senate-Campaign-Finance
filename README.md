Itemized, individual contributions to Nebraska Sens. Ben Sasse and Deb Fischer.

Sen. Deb Fischer was elected to the U.S. Senate to represent Nebraska in 2012. The csv file, pulled from the Federal Election Commission,
reflects the individual contributions to her campaign from 2013 to her re-election in 2012. Sen. Ben Sasse was elected to the Senate in
2014, his csv file reflects individual conors from 2015 to Aug. 28, 2019. The zip_code.csv combining U.S. zip codes with latitude and
longitude information was pulled from GitHub.

I began working with R and RStudio in mid-July, and wanted to try to take what I've learned and turn it into something to use for my job as 
a reporter at the Journal Star in Lincoln, Nebraska.
